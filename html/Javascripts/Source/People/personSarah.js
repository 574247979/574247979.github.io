/****************************************************************
	Sarah Gates

Basic after charm description about Sarah Gates on Charmed path:

You have carefully managed to seduce and charm Sarah without her uncle noticing it. Sarah warned you that her maid, Lauren should be put under your command if you haven’t done it yet, because Sarah has been blackmailing her to become her slave without any use of magic. Sarah is no longer in control of her life or any other’s, her sole purpose is to do anything you ask. You asked her to make a plan on how to put Sir Gates out of the picture, on which she quickly offered that she kills him in his sleep. As amusing as it is seeing her fierce loyalty, you stopped her, you are not a killer after all!
   Sarah is waiting for you in her room, her clothes become sluttier and more open each time you visit. She kisses your hand as you enter through the door and goes on all four and bows to you three times. She knows her manners that’s for sure!  That’s because she’s of noble blood.
